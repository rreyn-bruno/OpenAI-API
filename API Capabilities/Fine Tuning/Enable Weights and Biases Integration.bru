  Weights and Biases (W&B) is a popular tool for tracking machine learning experiments. You can use the OpenAI integration with W&B to track your fine-tuning jobs in W&B. This integration will automatically log metrics, hyperparameters, and other job-related information to the W&B project you specify.
  
  To integrate your fine-tuning jobs with W&B, you'll need to
  
  Provide authentication credentials for your Weights and Biases account to OpenAI
  Configure the W&B integration when creating new fine-tuning jobs
